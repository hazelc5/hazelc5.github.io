      <h1> To You, By The Park</h1>

      <img src="view copy.jpg" alt="view park" style="width:600px;height:400px;">

      <h2> By Hazel Corona</h2>

      <p>As you welcomed me and made me a resident of Brooklyn, I grew to love neighboring towns that you showcased. I have always loved to wander your streets by myself as a kid. I may not be the only one you gave this trait to, but the other residents that lived amongst your lined blocks, seeking something new in their same old schedule did so too. What made us all different however was the way we chose to navigate throughout the boroughs.
          We were the blood cells passing through your veins trying to reach your heart. Maybe your heart to the lady with her two kids kicking their legs in their seats was in Bushwick, or it was up in Harlem to the man tirelessly leaning his head up against the ad behind him on the train. We all had a place we cherished that we felt was the source of our livelihood. To me, it was by the Brooklyn Bridge, the monument rich with history that was different from the skyscrapers that scattered around Manhattan like stars at night, and it reigned over my Paradiso: the Brooklyn Bridge Park.</p>

          <p>As I spent my days roaming around Carroll Gardens and Red Hook, you gave me a hint and led me up north from Court St. and a few feet away, there stood the mighty bridge the world had its eyes on. The gothic-styled towers were suspended up in the sky and I felt awe. This was my kingdom. The first time I saw the Brooklyn Bridge, I felt pride that I knew what other New Yorkers felt when they saw this part of you. Continuing down the road, I followed the city line that I used as my Northern Star. The closer I got, the more vibrant my view became. And there it was, I made it to your heart.
          Years went by and I spent it with you, by the park wanting to know more and when I discovered something new about this place, I was never disappointed. Walking along the stony path, across the Freedom Tower and embracing the salty breeze, I felt satisfied with my destination that I encountered through endless roaming.</p>

          This however was not the end. When I got the sudden news that I was to move and depart from you, I wouldn’t think that anybody else in the world would feel pain as grand as mine. I didn’t want to leave you, nor did I want to leave the park that helped me understand every aspect of myself. If I needed to feel like a kid, I would skate away at the roller rink. If I needed to make myself feel better, I would treat myself to Ample Hills ice cream. If I needed to relax myself, I would sit by the grass meadow that existed amongst the oak trees. If I needed to exist, I would sit on a bench under the bridge. If I needed a break from the messy thoughts that I carried as an anxious teen, I’d run back to the park, because I gave it the honor of being my sanctuary, my home.
          In September, my final day in the city felt like my last day on Earth. I didn’t bother to visit your heart and embrace the feeling of community that I knew I longed for. I was afraid to say goodbye. I wasn’t sure about a lot of things, but one thing was for sure, I would continue to mourn in silence for your presence. </p>

          <p>Almost a year had passed by, I came back to visit you and I knew this time I wanted to visit Brooklyn Bridge Park. I skated and walked by the riverside knowing that by the time it struck 6:30, I would have to climb onto the ferry and I would have to depart once again. Is this how it ends? When I reached Manhattan, I stared back with tears rolling down my face at the park with all the laments my face could express.
          Months went by and by this time most  people would have already moved on, yet that wasn’t the case for me. Accepting a new life wasn’t the answer, it wasn’t the only option. So I begged to be returned back to you.
          Finally, I did return. Running from High Street to Old Fulton Street, my lungs burning alive, but my legs sprinted faster to reach my refuge. The park stood there graciously, like all those times I came to admire its beauty. Trees blooming there darkest shades of green, the sky piercing the atmosphere with its cerulean blue. At that moment, I realized I never want to feel mourning when it comes to you. As your Fidus Achates, it’s so good to see you back again.</p>
